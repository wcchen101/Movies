# Environment setup

Note: 
- Node v6.11 and npm v3.10.10 are used for development.

* Mac:
 1. Install Node (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 2. On your terminal, `cd` into the `movies` directory
 2. Initialize node modules by running `npm install` in the terminal
 3. Start the server using `npm run server` in the terminal
 4. Open browser and browse to `http://localhost:8080`

* Windows:
 1. Install Node (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 2. On your cmd prompt, `cd` into the `movies` directory
 2. Initialize node modules by running `npm install` in the cmd prompt
 3. Start the server using `npm run server` in the cmd prompt
 4. Open browser and browse to `http://localhost:8080`


## Instructions:
 1. First of all, thank you for taking the time to take our coding challenge. We are excited that you applied to Emprove!
 2. You will find data.json in the `src` folder. It contains a list of movie information and reviews for each movie.
 3. Read the data in data.json.
 4. Display the movies in a list. A screenshot is provided in mockup.png. The screenshot is taken from http://www.imdb.com/list/ls053420126/
 5. All images are available in `public/images` folder. The movie information we would like to see on the page is the image, title, year, synopsis, and url. The title should be clickable, which takes users to the url.
 6. Create a "Read Review" button for each movie. When users click one of them, the review for the specific movie will be expanded to show the review of the movie.

## Libraries:
 1. Please do not use other JS frameworks, such as JQuery, Angular, etc. React is already available for you to use.
 2. Feel free to use CSS frameworks, such as Bootstrap or Material UI.

## Objectives for this coding challenge:
- We would like to see how you structure your code in React and how you code in React.
- We would like to see if you are able to work with json data.
- Most importantly, we would like you to have fun doing it!
